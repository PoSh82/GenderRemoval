# GenderRemoval
Looks every 3 seconds for new text and removes words ending with "Innen" or "In" in many combinations with special characters on any webpage in order to see and read only the generic masculine form of words.

Install the extension Tampermonkey, create a new script and paste the sourcecode into it.
If you want to run the script on your mobile phone, you need to install Firefox and Tempermonkey on it.
